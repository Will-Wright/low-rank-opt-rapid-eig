Description
-----------

**Summary**

This software package solves large-scale phase retrieval and blind deconvolution problems by framing them as low-rank semidefinite programs. 

This package is a modification of the original package [low-rank-opt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mpf/pubs/low-rank-spectral-optimization-via-gauge-duality/) ([mirror](https://github.com/Will-Wright/low-rank-opt-orig)) by Michael Friedlander.  The method is based on the paper [Low-rank spectral optimization via gauge duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00315) by Michael Friedlander and Ives Macedo.  

Our software package uses the same main algorithm (`saga_sd.m`) and helper functions as the original `low-rank-opt` package.  Our modifications are summarized below and detailed in the **Contents** section.

**Contributions**

This fork optimizes the original package for handling noisy phase retrieval problems.  The original algorithm is very effective for noiseless models, but has difficulty handling noisy models.  The modifications focus on two goals:
   1. providing an optimal method for solving the eigenvalue subproblem in the main routine, and
   2. using reliable termination conditions to terminate when the algorithm stagnates.

Generating problem instances and solver inputs
----------------------------------------------

## Example: Phase-recovery experiments

Create options for the problem-generation routine `experiments.gendatapl`:
* 1-dim signal size 128
* random complex Gaussian signal
* octanary masks

```
gOpts = struct('n',128,'m',1,'signal','gaussian','mask','octanary');
```

Apply these solvers to the phase-recovery problem:
* `SAGA` (the gauge-dual approach)
* `SAGA-feas` (feasibility variant of `saga`)
* `TFOCS`
* `WFLOW`

```
setpath;
sOpts = struct('verbosity',0); # quiet, please!
stats(1) = experiments.pl('solver','saga','solverOpts',sOpts);
stats(2) = experiments.pl('solver','saga-feas','solverOpts',sOpts);
stats(3) = experiments.pl('solver','tfocs','solverOpts',sOpts);
stats(4) = experiments.pl('solver','wflow','solverOpts',sOpts);

# report relative errors in recovery
stats.xErrorRel
```

The script `experiments.pl` is a convenient way to generate data and apply a solver. For example:

1. generate data:
   * a random complex Gaussian signal `x0` of length `n = 128`
   * a measurement operator `A` based on octanary masks
   * the measurement vector `b`
   ```
   [A, b, x0, info] = ...
   experiments.gendatapl('n',128,'m',1,'signal','gaussian','mask','octanary');
   ```

2. Solve the PhaseLift problem for this instance using the gauge-dual approach:
  ```
  [x, r, info_sol] = saga_sd(A, b);
  ```

3. Report on the recovery error:
```
xError = util.hermitianerror(x(:),x0(:),'fro');
xErrorRel = xError / norm(x0)^2; % = ||xx'-x0x0'||_F/||x0x0'||_F
```

## Example: blind deconvolution
```
solver = 'saga';       % other options: `saga-feas` and `aug-lag`
filtername = 'motion'; % other options: `cmotion` and `dcmotion`
genOpts = struct('filtername',filtername);
stats = experiments.bd('solver',solver,'genOpts',genOpts);
```

Generating the tables in the paper
----------------------------------

First step is making sure you are at the main folder and then setting the paths
by calling:
```
setpath
```

The tables in the paper can be generated with the commands below.

*Warning:* Some of the tests can take significant amount of time because
they run many thousands of examples. We suggest that you first download
the solution cache file (2.4GB):
```
unzip('http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mpf/low-rank-opt/cache.zip')
```

* For the full random Gaussian noiseless experiments:
```
experiments.noiselesspl
```

* For the full random instances with noise:
```
experiments.noisypl
```

* For the large nebula image:
```
experiments.naturalpl
```

* For the blind deconvolution problem:
```
experiments.shapesbd
```

It might be interesting to run smaller problems to get acquainted with the
outputs and have a faster run. For that, the following are appropriate:

* For a subset of the random Gaussian signals (without noise):
```
experiments.noiselesspl('test',true)
```

* For a subset of the random instances with noise:
```
experiments.noisypl('test',true)
```

* For smaller (rescaled) versions of the nebula image (feel free to substitute
  the 1/50 parameter by another value for different rescalings):
```
experiments.naturalpl('resizeImage',1/50)
```

Data directory
--------------
* `nebula.tif`: resized image from [Hubble Telescope][].

[Hubble Telescope]: http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/nebula/2015/12/image/a/

Cache directory
---------------
This directory contains outputs from the experiments used to generate the tables
in the paper.

* `.mat` files are generated with the output info for each of the solvers
and the main parameters used. For example:
    - `solution_saga-feas_11_1.mat` contains the output info from running the
      solver `SAGA-feas` on the noiseless phase recovery problem with 11 masks
      and 2 as seed for the random number generator;
    - `solution_wflow_9_0_050_1.mat` contains the output info from running the
      solver `WFLOW` on the noisy phase recovery problem with 9 masks, 0.050 as
      eta and 1 as seed for the random number generator;
    - `wusterland_saga_10.mat` contains the output info from running the solver
      `SAGA` on the noiseless phase recovery problem for the nebula image with
      10 masks;
    - `shapesbd_aug-lag.mat` contains the output info from running the augmented
      Lagrangian solver on the blind deconvolution problem.

* `.png` files are generated to depict the images used in the blind
deconvolution problem. In this case, no matter what solver is used, the files
terminating on: `*_signal.png`, `*_kernel.png` and `*_measur.png` are all equal
across solvers as they depict the original input image, the original motion
blur kernel and the exact measurements, respectively. For example:
    - `aug-lag_signalEst.png` depicts the estimated (deblurred) image computed
      by the augmented Lagrangian solver;
    - `saga-feas_kernelEst.png` depicts the estimated motion blur kernel
      computed by the `SAGA-feas` solver;
    - `saga_measurEst.png` depicts the measurements computed with the estimated
      signal and motion blur kernel by the `SAGA` solver.
