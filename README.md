Description
-----------


This software package accompanies the dissertation [A Rapid Eigenvalue Method for Noisy Phase Retrieval](https://github.com/Will-Wright/dissertation-rapid_eigenvalue_method_for_noisy_phase_retrieval/blob/master/will_wright_dissertation.pdf) and solves large-scale phase retrieval and blind deconvolution problems by framing them as low-rank semidefinite programs. 

Note that this package is a modification of the original package [low-rank-opt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mpf/pubs/low-rank-spectral-optimization-via-gauge-duality/) ([mirror](https://github.com/Will-Wright/low-rank-opt-orig)) by Michael Friedlander.  The underlying phase retrieval algorithm `saga_sd` is based on the paper [Low-rank spectral optimization via gauge duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00315) by Michael Friedlander and Ives Macedo.  Our modifications are summarized below and detailed in the **Contents** section.

### New Contributions:

This fork offers a new method for handling the sequence of eigenvalue problems in `saga_sd` which is the computational bottleneck of the `saga_sd` algorithm for noisy phase retrieval problems.  The original algorithm is very effective for noiseless models, but has difficulty handling noisy models.  Our modifications offer two primary improvements to `saga_sd`:
   1. implementing an optimal method (`adaptive_eigs_params`) for solving the eigenvalue subproblem in the main routine, and
   2. establishing reliable termination conditions to terminate when the algorithm stagnates.


Demo Tutorials
--------------

The following experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the new `adaptive_eigs_params` algorithm (which we call `saga_sd rapid-eig`) for solving the sequence of eigenvalue problems in `saga_sd`.  We also show the effectiveness of the `saga_sd` algorithm for noisy phase retrieval.

### Comparison of `saga_sd` and `saga_sd rapid-eig`

* `experiments.figure.noisyimage_adaptive_eig_full_exp`: runs a series of experiments (with results cached in this repository) demonstrating the efficiency of `saga_sd rapid-eig` for a variety of phase retrieval problems. Generates the following results (along with many other plots).

This plot demonstrates that `saga_sd rapid-eig` (red dashed line) is more efficient than `saga_sd` (blue solid line) for a variety of random phase retrieval problems with varying size (left), oversampling rate (middle), and noise ratio (right).

This table shows `saga_sd rapid-eig` is nearly optimal in the sense of selecting the best parameter (number of requested eigenvalues `r` in the MATLAB function 
[eigs](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eigs.html)) for each iterate in the sequence of eigenvalue problems.  Note that `m` refers to the block-size in `eigs`, `L` is the phase retrieval oversampling rate, and `epsilon_rel` is the noise ratio.  See chapters 6 and 7 of the dissertation [A Rapid Eigenvalue Method for Noisy Phase Retrieval](https://github.com/Will-Wright/dissertation-rapid_eigenvalue_method_for_noisy_phase_retrieval/blob/master/will_wright_dissertation.pdf) for details.

Note: you may also run `experiments.figure.noisyimage_adaptive_eig_demo` for a smaller set of experiments and results.




### Adaptive parameter selection method based on grid search results

* `experiments.figure.noisyimage_adaptive_eig_full_exp`: plots surfaces which demonstrate the difference in computational costs (`Number mat-vec` products) for various iterates in the phase retrieval algorithm `saga_sd` and various choice of parameter `Number eigenvalues requested`. 
The top plot shows that the optimal parameter `Number eigenvalues requested` for `eigs` changes, and generally increase for later iterates.
The bottom plot shows that this change in optimal `Number eigenvalues requested` coincides with a clustering of the algebraically largest eigenvalues.
Computing clustered eigenvalues is known to be difficult and these insights led to the development of the `adaptive_eigs_params` algorithm.

### Comparison of `saga_sd` and [`wflow`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1065) for noisy phase retrieval

* `experiments.table.noisyrandom_saga_vs_wflow_rel_errs`: demonstrates `saga_sd` is generally more likely to recover an accurate signal than the competitor `wflow` algorithm for noisy phase retrieval problems.

* `experiments.figure.noisyimage_signal_relerr_various_saga_iterates`: solves two noisy image recovery problems (with noise ratios 10% and 30%) and displays figures from various iterates, demonstrating that `saga_sd` makes significant progress in 20 iterations.

Generating problem instances and solver inputs
----------------------------------------------

## Example: Phase-recovery experiments

Create options for the problem-generation routine `experiments.gendatapl`:
* 1-dim signal size 128
* random complex Gaussian signal
* octanary masks

```
gOpts = struct('n',128,'m',1,'signal','gaussian','mask','octanary');
```

Apply these solvers to the phase-recovery problem:
* `SAGA` (the gauge-dual approach)
* `SAGA-feas` (feasibility variant of `saga`)
* `TFOCS`
* `WFLOW`

```
setpath;
sOpts = struct('verbosity',0); # quiet, please!
stats(1) = experiments.pl('solver','saga','solverOpts',sOpts);
stats(2) = experiments.pl('solver','saga-feas','solverOpts',sOpts);
stats(3) = experiments.pl('solver','tfocs','solverOpts',sOpts);
stats(4) = experiments.pl('solver','wflow','solverOpts',sOpts);

# report relative errors in recovery
stats.xErrorRel
```

The script `experiments.pl` is a convenient way to generate data and apply a solver. For example:

1. generate data:
   * a random complex Gaussian signal `x0` of length `n = 128`
   * a measurement operator `A` based on octanary masks
   * the measurement vector `b`
   ```
   [A, b, x0, info] = ...
   experiments.gendatapl('n',128,'m',1,'signal','gaussian','mask','octanary');
   ```

2. Solve the PhaseLift problem for this instance using the gauge-dual approach:
  ```
  [x, r, info_sol] = saga_sd(A, b);
  ```

3. Report on the recovery error:
```
xError = util.hermitianerror(x(:),x0(:),'fro');
xErrorRel = xError / norm(x0)^2; % = ||xx'-x0x0'||_F/||x0x0'||_F
```

## Example: blind deconvolution
```
solver = 'saga';       % other options: `saga-feas` and `aug-lag`
filtername = 'motion'; % other options: `cmotion` and `dcmotion`
genOpts = struct('filtername',filtername);
stats = experiments.bd('solver',solver,'genOpts',genOpts);
```

Generating the tables in the paper
----------------------------------

First step is making sure you are at the main folder and then setting the paths
by calling:
```
setpath
```

The tables in the paper can be generated with the commands below.

*Warning:* Some of the tests can take significant amount of time because
they run many thousands of examples. We suggest that you first download
the solution cache file (2.4GB):
```
unzip('http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mpf/low-rank-opt/cache.zip')
```

* For the full random Gaussian noiseless experiments:
```
experiments.noiselesspl
```

* For the full random instances with noise:
```
experiments.noisypl
```

* For the large nebula image:
```
experiments.naturalpl
```

* For the blind deconvolution problem:
```
experiments.shapesbd
```

It might be interesting to run smaller problems to get acquainted with the
outputs and have a faster run. For that, the following are appropriate:

* For a subset of the random Gaussian signals (without noise):
```
experiments.noiselesspl('test',true)
```

* For a subset of the random instances with noise:
```
experiments.noisypl('test',true)
```

* For smaller (rescaled) versions of the nebula image (feel free to substitute
  the 1/50 parameter by another value for different rescalings):
```
experiments.naturalpl('resizeImage',1/50)
```

Data directory
--------------
* `nebula.tif`: resized image from [Hubble Telescope][].

[Hubble Telescope]: http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/nebula/2015/12/image/a/

Cache directory
---------------
This directory contains outputs from the experiments used to generate the tables
in the paper.

* `.mat` files are generated with the output info for each of the solvers
and the main parameters used. For example:
    - `solution_saga-feas_11_1.mat` contains the output info from running the
      solver `SAGA-feas` on the noiseless phase recovery problem with 11 masks
      and 2 as seed for the random number generator;
    - `solution_wflow_9_0_050_1.mat` contains the output info from running the
      solver `WFLOW` on the noisy phase recovery problem with 9 masks, 0.050 as
      eta and 1 as seed for the random number generator;
    - `wusterland_saga_10.mat` contains the output info from running the solver
      `SAGA` on the noiseless phase recovery problem for the nebula image with
      10 masks;
    - `shapesbd_aug-lag.mat` contains the output info from running the augmented
      Lagrangian solver on the blind deconvolution problem.

* `.png` files are generated to depict the images used in the blind
deconvolution problem. In this case, no matter what solver is used, the files
terminating on: `*_signal.png`, `*_kernel.png` and `*_measur.png` are all equal
across solvers as they depict the original input image, the original motion
blur kernel and the exact measurements, respectively. For example:
    - `aug-lag_signalEst.png` depicts the estimated (deblurred) image computed
      by the augmented Lagrangian solver;
    - `saga-feas_kernelEst.png` depicts the estimated motion blur kernel
      computed by the `SAGA-feas` solver;
    - `saga_measurEst.png` depicts the measurements computed with the estimated
      signal and motion blur kernel by the `SAGA` solver.
